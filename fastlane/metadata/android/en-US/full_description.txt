A multi-purpose counter app

* Track good and bad habits (eg: exercising, smoking, drinking...)
* Track when's the last time you did something (eg: water your plants, change your bedsheets, poop...)
* Count your lives in MtG

Features:

* Records the date of each individual counter increase, so upcoming versions can graph your data and calculate statistics.
* Your data is never sent to any server (except for Google's auto-backup, if it's enabled).
* Simple and will stay this way.
